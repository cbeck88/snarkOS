//! Validator participation telemetry.
//!
//! Telemetry is observational: the participation scores computed here feed the
//! gateway's heartbeat log, the consensus metrics gauges, and a REST endpoint.
//! Nothing in consensus reads them. This module is structured around that fact.
//!
//! The state is owned by a single background task ([`TelemetryWorker`]) rather
//! than shared behind locks, which gives three properties:
//!
//! - The BFT path can never block on telemetry. Enqueueing an update is
//!   wait-free; if the worker were to fall behind, updates are dropped and a
//!   warning is logged, degrading a metric rather than a consensus decision.
//! - Telemetry can never deadlock against a `rayon` parallel iterator. The
//!   previous lock-based implementation carried a doc comment forbidding its
//!   locks from being touched inside (or across) a parallel iterator, enforced
//!   only by review. There is now no lock for a parallel iterator to block on.
//! - Recomputing the participation scores, which is `O(validators * rounds)`,
//!   is coalesced: the worker drains its whole queue before recomputing once.
//!
//! Readers observe the most recently published snapshot through a
//! [`tokio::sync::watch`] channel. That channel does have an internal lock, but
//! it is held only long enough to clone an `Arc`, there is exactly one writer,
//! and no other lock is ever acquired underneath it, so no cycle can form.
//!
//! # Eventual consistency under dropped updates
//!
//! Because a full queue drops updates, the scores can be temporarily wrong. They
//! are, however, guaranteed to become correct again, and the reason is a property
//! of [`TelemetryState`] that must be preserved by anyone changing it:
//!
//! **Every piece of tracked state is keyed by round, and garbage collection prunes
//! by round.** `tracked_certificates` is keyed by round; `validator_signatures`
//! holds a per-round count for each validator rather than a running total; and
//! `validator_certificates` holds a set of rounds. So the entire contribution of
//! any given round can be, and is, removed wholesale by
//! [`TelemetryState::garbage_collect_certificates`].
//!
//! A dropped subdag update means the rounds it covered are never inserted. Once
//! `gc_round` advances past those rounds, a state that missed them and a state that
//! saw them contain *exactly the same data*, because the only difference between
//! them lived in rounds that have since been pruned. Since `gc_round` is derived
//! from the anchor round of each committed subdag, it advances on its own as
//! consensus proceeds, so the gap always ages out --- after `MAX_GC_ROUNDS` rounds
//! beyond the highest dropped round. `test_scores_converge_after_dropped_updates`
//! pins this down.
//!
//! The load-bearing part is the per-round keying. If `validator_signatures` held an
//! aggregate count instead of a per-round breakdown, a dropped update would leave a
//! permanent deficit that garbage collection could never repair, and the scores
//! would be wrong forever. Do not aggregate across rounds in this state machine.
//!
//! [`Telemetry::is_complete`] reports whether the currently published scores have
//! caught up: the handle records the highest round affected by a drop, and the
//! worker publishes the `gc_round` its scores were computed at.
