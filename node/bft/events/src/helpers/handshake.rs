//! The payloads carried by the messages of the gateway's Noise handshake.
//!
//! Unlike the legacy [`ChallengeRequest`](crate::ChallengeRequest) and
//! [`ChallengeResponse`](crate::ChallengeResponse) events, these are not part of the [`Event`]
//! enum: they are only ever exchanged inside a Noise message, never over an established connection.
//!
//! The four messages are:
//!
//! 1. `->` [`HandshakeHint`] - cleartext, so the responder can bail out before doing any work.
//! 2. `<-` [`PeerInfo`] - the responder's metadata, deliberately without a signature.
//! 3. `->` [`InitiatorInfo`] - the initiator's metadata *and* the proof of its identity.
//! 4. `<-` [`ResponderProof`] - the responder's verdict, and its own proof if the initiator checked
//!    out. This is the first transport message, the pattern having ended with the third.
//!
//! # Important: how the initiator's metadata is bound to its signature
//!
//! The initiator signs the handshake hash as it stands after message 2. Its metadata is tied to that
//! signature by one of two mechanisms, depending on which message carries it:
//!
//! - Messages 1 and 2 are folded into the hash - Noise mixes a message's payload into `h` whether or
//!   not a key has been established yet, so even the cleartext [`HandshakeHint`] is covered by the
//!   signature. Tampering with it in flight makes the two sides derive different hashes, and the
//!   handshake fails.
//! - Message 3 is *not* covered by the hash the initiator signed, and is bound instead by its AEAD
//!   tag: only the two endpoints can derive the key, so the party that produced the signature is
//!   necessarily the party that sent [`InitiatorInfo`] alongside it.
//!
//! Either placement is sound, so metadata may be moved into the hint if there is a reason to act on
//! it earlier. What must not change is that anything the responder acts on ends up covered by one of
//! the two: metadata reaching it unencrypted *after* message 2 would be bound by neither.
//!
//! The separate reason the responder re-checks the hint against [`InitiatorInfo`] is a
//! self-inconsistent initiator, not tampering. Nothing stops a peer from claiming one value in the
//! hint, having the responder run its early checks against it, and then authenticating a different
//! one - so every field duplicated between the two must be compared, and the connection rejected
//! when they disagree.
